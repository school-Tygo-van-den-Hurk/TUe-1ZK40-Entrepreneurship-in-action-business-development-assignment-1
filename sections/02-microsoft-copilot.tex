\section{Microsoft Copilot}
    
    For the assignment, we had to create and use a Microsoft Copilot prompt, and this is what we came up with: 
    
    I want to start with an entrepreneurial endeavor involving gravity base energy storage technology. The focus is on sustainability and the specific application of energy storage. I need to find several market opportunities that involve this technology, and I want the different market opportunities to follow from [MON worksheet 1], and afterwards I want them analyzed using [MON worksheet 2]. Give a clear table of these opportunities following these rules: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Include both more well-known market segments, as well as novel and niche segments;
        \item Use variety across industries;
        \item Use reliable sources such as industry reports, patents, and technology trend databases;
        \item Name both the market needs, as well as how this opportunity satisfies these needs;
        \item Take relevance into account.
    \end{itemize}

    The responds we got from that prompt was very detailed, which is why it’s in the appendix. We then proceeded to choose the market opportunities we thought had the most potential.
